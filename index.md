# About Me

My name is Tim Alberts and I work in software development and technology.  Please refer to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-alberts-87303430/) profile for more details.

## My Education

While my original interests started with electronics and hardware, my passion for writing software eventually won over.

Having some general engineering and computer science education following high school, plus an AAS degree from ITT in electronics, I was able to get myself into the work world and continued to build my skills and experience.  Following some life and career changes I made the decision to finish my BA degree in computer science.  This landed me at SNHU.

With my journey through the CS program coming to an end, I can reflect back on what was achieved.
